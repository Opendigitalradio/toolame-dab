 *
 * Motorola processors (Macintosh, Sun, Sparc, MIPS, etc)
 * pack bytes from high to low (they are big-endian).
 * Use the HighLow routines to match the native format
 * of these machines.
 *
 * Intel-like machines (PCs, Sequent)
 * pack bytes from low to high (the are little-endian).
 * Use the LowHigh routines to match the native format
 * of these machines.
 *
 * These routines have been tested on the following machines:
 *	Apple Macintosh, MPW 3.1 C compiler
 *	Apple Macintosh, THINK C compiler
 *	Silicon Graphics IRIS, MIPS compiler
 *	Cray X/MP and Y/MP
 *	Digital Equipment VAX
 *
 *
 * Implemented by Malcolm Slaney and Ken Turkowski.
 *
 * Malcolm Slaney contributions during 1988-1990 include big- and little-
 * endian file I/O, conversion to and from Motorola's extended 80-bit
 * FLOATing-point format, and conversions to and from IEEE single-
 * precision FLOATing-point format.
 *
 * In 1991, Ken Turkowski implemented the conversions to and from
 * IEEE double-precision format, added more precision to the extended
 * conversions, and accommodated conversions involving +/- infinity,
 * NaN's, and denormalized numbers.
